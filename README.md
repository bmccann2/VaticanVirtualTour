# VaticanVirtualTour
In 2016 I was privileged enough to participate in an internship program with Vaitcan museums.  While there I was able to work on their virtual tour project. Unfortunately I am unable to share the code for this project but you can view the results here: http://www.museivaticani.va/content/museivaticani/it/collezioni/musei/museo-pio-clementino/tour-virtuale.html

I worked on the following sections: Raphael Rooms, Pio Clementino Museum, Chiramonti Museum, and the Pine Court
